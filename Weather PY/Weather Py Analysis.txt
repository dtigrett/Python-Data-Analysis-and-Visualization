Weather Py Analysis

From the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:

Temperature seems to have a clear correlation with latitude.
In the Northern Hemisphere temperature versus latitude has an r value of -0.83 
indicating there is a high positive (negative) correlation.

In the Southern Hemisphere temperature versus latitude has an r value of 0.75
indicating there is a high positive correlation.

Temperature increases as we approach the equator. 

Humidity does not show a strong correlation to latitude.
In the northern hemisphere there is an r value of 0.22 and in the
southern hemisphere there is an r value of -0.03 indicating there 
is neglibile or no correlation.


There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. 
In the northern hemisphere there is an r value of 0.1 and in the 
southern hemisphere there is an r value of 0.02 indicating there is
no correlation.


There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. In the northern 
hemisphere the r value is 0.02 and in the southern hemisphere the
r value is -0.11 indicating there is no correlation.
