Weather Py Analysis

From the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:

Temperature has a strong correlation with latitude.
In the Northern Hemisphere temperature versus latitude has
an r value of -0.83 indicating there is a high 
(negative) positive correlation.

In the Southern Hemisphere temperature versus latitude has
an r value of 0.72
indicating there is a high positive correlation.

Temperature increases as we approach the equator. 

Humidity does not show a strong correlation to latitude.
In the northern hemisphere there is an r value of 0.21 and in the
southern hemisphere there is an r value of 0.21 indicating there 
is neglibile or no correlation.


There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. 
In the northern hemisphere there is an r value of 0.13 and in the 
southern hemisphere there is an r value of -0.3 indicating there is
no correlation.


There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. 
In the northern hemisphere the r value is 0.07 and in the
southern hemisphere ther value is -0.2 indicating there is no 
correlation.
